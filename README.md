# Java 12 XML to JSON Benchmark Test

Benchmark Java's ability to transform XML to JSON.

## Prerequisites

### Minimum Software Required To Deploy Application

You **only** need these items to run the application on any supported device:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Getting Started

### Provide XML Payload To Test

Place your XML payload at `payload.xml` in the project root directory (same dir as this readme).

### Configure environment parameters (optional)

View `docker-compose.yml` to modify defaults. Here are the vanilla values:

    ITERATION_COUNT=1000000
    THREAD_COUNT=8

### Build Docker Image & Run Application

    docker-compose up --build
    
The test will begin as soon as the application finishes building and starts.
